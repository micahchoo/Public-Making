What: Understanding how to translate software words, by first showing etymology of the word itself
Remarks: 90% legwork done by ChatGPT
---

> Computer terms from the software category:

A table like this can be extremely beneficial in developing computing paradigms for non-English, less-industrialized regions. The key ways it can be useful include:

1. **Language Localization and Translation:** Understanding the etymology of the terms can make it easier to translate these terms into other languages, particularly languages from less-industrialized regions. For example, the term "backup" could be translated into a local language by finding a word or phrase that conveys the concept of providing support or reserve.

2. **Contextual Understanding:** This table provides a functional connection of each term to its corresponding artifact or phenomenon, which can help in explaining complex computing concepts in simple, understandable terms. For instance, explaining a "file" as a resource for storing information, similar to how a thread holds together elements in a sequence, could make it easier for non-English speakers to grasp the concept.

3. **Creating New Terms:** In some languages, particularly those from less-industrialized regions, there may not be existing terms for some computing concepts. In such cases, understanding the etymology and functional connection can aid in creating new terms. For instance, for the term "software," we could look for words in the target language that convey the concept of "instructions" or "guidance," and pair it with a word that contrasts with the term for physical equipment (analogous to "hardware").

4. **Cultural Sensitivity:** The understanding of the etymology and the function of a term can assist in maintaining cultural sensitivity by avoiding words or phrases that may have negative or different connotations in other cultures. For example, the term "crash" might have a direct, alarming translation in another language. Understanding that it refers to the sudden failure or stopping of a program, a more culturally sensitive term could be developed.

5. **Education and Training:** The table can be used as an educational resource for training programs in these regions. By providing both the etymology and the functional connection of each term, it can facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of these concepts.

For instance, for a language in a less-industrialized region that doesn't have a term for "database," we might look at the functional description: an organized collection of data, stored and accessed electronically. We could then look for a way to convey this concept using existing words or phrases in that language. Perhaps there's a term for a physical repository or a library, which could be adapted to create a new term. 

Similarly, for the concept of "drag and drop," we might look for words or phrases that describe the physical act of moving an object from one place to another. We could then use these words to develop a term that conveys the concept of dragging and dropping in a digital environment.
