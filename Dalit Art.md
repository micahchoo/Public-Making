Thenmozhi Soundarajan - Thenmozhi Soundararajan—first Dalit artist featured in a New York contemporary-art show—with her work in #PerilousBodies.The portraits of caste-oppressed women demand they be seen with humanity and empathy--not through the restrictions that have governed their lives.That’s why the artist used the copper plate, the form historically used to inscribe caste laws, to create her defiant memorials.She titled the piece “Ama, Amachi, and Mother. We are still here”#InternationalWomensDay
