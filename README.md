# Public-Making
For things that need to be made in public and need collaborators, like half-baked wikipedia ideas
1. [Wikipedia Page on Dalit Art](Dalit%20Art.md)
   - I want to build a wikipedia page about dalit art or artists
3. [Pattern Library on Offline Stores soliciting personal data](How-Offline-Stores-get-your-Personal-Data-A-Pattern-Library.md)
   - If you join this project as a collaborator, you would research and collect more examples of how stores collect data from customers. You might observe and study practices in your own area, talk to store owners or customers, and provide your insights on the effects of these practices. Your unique perspective and research would be valuable in expanding our understanding of these practices.
4. [Tech Translation - Alternatives from Etymology](Tech%20Translation%20-%20Alternatives%20from%20Etymology.md)
    - List of technology terms, how they came to be named and what do they actually do - for translators - if there is no similar metaphor in your language, to help you come up with better alternatives rather than using the loan word
6. [South Asia - Awesome Digital History:  A curated list of awesome things related to South Asian digital history](https://micahchoo.github.io/awesome-digital-history-South-Asia/)
   - [Edit on Github](https://github.com/micahchoo/awesome-digital-history-South-Asia)
   - A curated list of awesome things related to South Asian digital history.
7. [Author Bios - Sahitya Akademi](https://archive.org/details/SahityaAkademiAuthorBios) 
    - This is a bunch of docs scraped from Sahitya Akademi that are detailed bios of some Indian authors. Most of them are from the time period 2006-09. The docs were merged. Archive.org should do OCR on it, which hopefully gives usable strings of text that can be used as sources on wikipedia. 
    -[Sahitya Akademi Author Bios  Sahitya Akademi  Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming  Internet Archive - archive.org](https://archive.org/details/SahityaAkademiAuthorBios/page/n127/mode/2up?q=confer)
    Need Help chapterizing.
6. [if you learn 232 words and then listen to native speakers, you'll get a decent grasp on any language](232-words-to-learn-a-language.md)
   - [CSV here](Tech%20terms.csv) 
   - This project aims to create a collaborative language learning resource by compiling a list of transliterated translations of common words in various languages. By learning these translations, language learners can quickly acquire basic vocabulary and engage in simple conversations in different languages. Similar to fluent-forever's 625 words but adapted for indian languages
