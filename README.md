5. [Author Bios - Sahitya Akademi](https://archive.org/details/SahityaAkademiAuthorBios) - 
    This is a bunch of docs scraped from Sahitya Akademi that are detailed bios of some Indian authors. Most of them are from the time period 2006-09. The docs were merged. Archive.org should do OCR on it, which hopefully gives usable strings of text that can be used as sources on wikipedia.
