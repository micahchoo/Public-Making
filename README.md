# Public-Making
For things that need to be made in public, like half-baked wikipedia ideas
1. [Wikipedia Page on Dalit Art](Dalit%20Art.md)
2. [Pattern Library on Offline Stores soliciting personal data](How-Offline-Stores-get-your-Personal-Data-A-Pattern-Library.md)
3. [Tech Translation - Alternatives from Etymology](Tech%20Translation%20-%20Alternatives%20from%20Etymology.md)

   - [Edit on Github](https://github.com/micahchoo/awesome-digital-history-South-Asia)
5. [SAuthor Bios - Sahitya Akademi](https://archive.org/details/SahityaAkademiAuthorBios) - This is a bunch of docs scraped from Sahitya Akademi that are detailed bios of some Indian authors. Most of them are from the time period 2006-09. The docs were merged. Archive.org should do OCR on it, which hopefully gives usable strings of text that can be used as sources on wikipedia. I'll upload a transcript here.
